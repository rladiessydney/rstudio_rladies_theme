# R-Ladies Sydney: Custom RStudio Theme

Welcome to the R-Ladies Sydney Custom RStudio Theme Project! 🎨✨

This repository is the starting point for our collaborative effort to create a custom *RStudio theme* inspired by the R-Ladies community. 

This is a space to work together to design a unique theme that reflects the values and aesthetics of R-Ladies, to share and refine our creation as a community!
